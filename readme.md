---
GhostWriter uses [INgage Networks's API](http://developer.ingagenetworks.com/) as the data store for drafted content for each of the ghostwriter's clients. Once reviewed, the blog, blogposts, and comments are published to [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), the client's public facing blog. Fans can then comment using Tumblr or SMS, via [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/)'s API.
